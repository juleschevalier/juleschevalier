## About

After a PhD on Incremental Reasoning on data streams, I worked as a DevOps Engineer for 2 years. Since november 2018 I am Head of Research & Innovation at Peaks, Lyon.
In parallel, I am since 2017 Associate Teacher at Telecom Saint Etienne, responsible for various classes on DevOps, Java, Git, NodeJS and agile methods.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Brin'Git](https://github.com/peaks/bringit), a didactic and transparent GUI for Git using Gamification. It is an Open Source project, feel free to explore, share and get involved!
